/*
	The number, 1406357289, is a 0 to 9 pandigital number because it is
	made up of each of the digits 0 to 9 in some order, but it also has
	a rather interesting sub-string divisibility property.

	Let d_1 be the 1st digit, d_2 be the 2nd digit, and so on.
	In this way, we note the following:

		d_2 * d_3 * d_4  = 406 is divisible by  2
		d_3 * d_4 * d_5  = 063 is divisible by  3
		d_4 * d_5 * d_6  = 635 is divisible by  5
		d_5 * d_6 * d_7  = 357 is divisible by  7
		d_6 * d_7 * d_8  = 572 is divisible by 11
		d_7 * d_8 * d_9  = 728 is divisible by 13
		d_8 * d_9 * d_10 = 289 is divisible by 17

	Find the sum of all 0 to 9 pandigital numbers with this property.
